\description{
Estimate a Threshold Vector Error Correction model (VECM)
}
\details{
For fixed threshold and cointegrating vector, the model is linear, so
estimation of the regression parameters can be done directly by CLS
(Conditional Least Squares). The search of the threshold and cointegrating
parameters values which minimize the residual sum of squares (SSR) is made on
a grid of potential values. For specification of the grids, see below.

The function can estimate one as well as two thresholds:

\describe{ \item{nthresh=1:}{ estimation of one threshold model (two regimes)
upon a grid of \var{ngridTh} values (default to ALL) possible thresholds and
delays values. }

\item{nthresh=2:}{estimation of two thresholds model (three regimes).
Conditional on the threshold found in model where nthresh=1, the second
threshold is searched. When both are found, a second grid search is made with
30 values around each threshold.} }

The model can be either with a threshold effect on all variables ("All") or
only on the error correction term (ECT) (argument "only ECT"). In the second
case, the value for the middle threshold is taken a null, as in Balke and
Fomby (1997).

The grid for the threshold parameters can be set in different ways, through
the argument \var{th1}, \var{th2} and \var{beta}:

\describe{ 
\item{exact:}{Pre-specified value (for beta: cointegrating vector will be c(1,\code{-beta}))} 
\item{int:}{Specify an interval (of length \var{ngridTh}) in which to search.}
\item{around:}{Specify to take \var{ngridTh} points around the value given. }
}

The default is to do an interval search. Interval bounds for the threshold
interval are simply the \var{trim} and 1-\var{trim} percents of the sorted
error correction term.  For the cointegrating parameter, bounds of the
interval are obtained from the (OLS) confidence interval of the linear
cointegration case.  It is often found however that this interval is too
tight. It is hence recommended to inspect the plot of the grid search.

data(zeroyld)

##Estimate a TVECM (we use here minimal grid, it should be usually much bigger!)

tvec <- TVECM(zeroyld, nthresh=2,lag=1, ngridBeta=20, ngridTh=30, plot=TRUE,trim=0.05, common="All")

print(tvec)
summary(tvec)

#Obtain diverse infos:

BIC(tvec)

res.tvec<-residuals(tvec)

#export the equations as Latex:
