	industries tend to be rigid and that pricing is often asymmetric
	with price rises occurring more frequently than price reductions
	(Domberger [1987]). Existing explanations of price rigidity and asymmetric
	pricing assume that firms incur "menu costs" when they adjust their
	prices. There is, however, little empirical evidence to substantiate
	this assumption. This paper provides an alternative explanation for
	price rigidity as well as asymmetric price adjustment in the absence
	of menu costs. In an infinitely repeated duopoly with incomplete
	information, it is demonstrated that depending on the degree of collusion
	and parameters, a variety of pricing behaviour emerge in equilibrium.},

  abstract = {The threshold autoregressive model is one of the nonlinear time series
	models available in the literature. It was first proposed by Tong
	(1978) and discussed in detail by Tong and Lim (1980) and Tong (1983).
	The major features of this class of models are limit cycles, amplitude
	dependent frequencies, and jump phenomena. Much of the original motivation
	of the model is concerned with limit cycles of a cyclical time series,
	and indeed the model is capable of producing asymmetric limit cycles.
	The threshold autoregressive model, however, has not received much
	attention in application. This is due to (a) the lack of a suitable
	modeling procedure and (b) the inability to identify the threshold
	variable and estimate the threshold values. The primary goal of this
	article, therefore, is to suggest a simple yet widely applicable
	model-building procedure for threshold autoregressive models. Based
	on some predictive residuals, a simple statistic is proposed to test
	for threshold nonlinearity and specify the threshold variable. Some
	supplementary graphic devices are then used to identify the number
	and locations of the potential thresholds. Finally, these statistics
	are used to build a threshold model. The test statistic and its properties
	are derived by simple linear regression. Its performance in the finite-sample
	case is evaluated by simulation and real-world data analysis. The
	statistic performs well as compared with an alternative test available
	in the literature. Further applications of threshold autoregressive
	models are also suggested, including handling heterogeneous time
	series and modeling random processes with periodic variances whose
	periodicity is not fixed. The latter phenomenon is commonly encountered
	in practice, especially in econometrics and biological sciences.},
